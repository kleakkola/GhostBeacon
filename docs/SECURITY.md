# Security Policy

## Overview

GhostBeacon takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and known considerations.

## Security Features

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Groth16/Halo2 proof verification
- Nullifier-based anti-replay protection
- No identity exposure in transactions

### Access Control
- Owner-only administrative functions
- Campaign-specific permissions
- Authorized spender system for treasury

### Anti-Fraud
- Reputation scoring system
- Rate limiting per user/device
- Blacklist functionality
- Device fingerprinting

### Financial Security
- ReentrancyGuard on all payable functions
- Pull payment pattern in treasury
- Timelock for large transfers
- Budget enforcement

## Threat Model

### Considered Threats

1. **Replay Attacks**: Prevented by nullifier system
2. **Sybil Attacks**: Mitigated by fraud detection
3. **Reentrancy**: Protected by OpenZeppelin guards
4. **Front-running**: Minimal impact due to ZK proofs
5. **Budget Drainage**: Enforced limits and validations

### Out of Scope

- Off-chain ZK proof generation security
- Private key management
- Network-level attacks
- Social engineering

## Known Limitations

### 1. Proof Verification Placeholder
The current implementation uses a placeholder for actual ZK proof verification. In production, this must be replaced with:
- Actual Groth16/Halo2 verifier contract
- Proper pairing checks
- Circuit-specific verification logic

### 2. Centralization Points
- Contract ownership (should use multisig)
- Campaign root updates (requires trusted authority)
- Fraud detection parameters (admin-controlled)

### 3. Gas Costs
- ZK verification can be gas-intensive
- Batch operations recommended for efficiency
- Consider L2 deployment for lower costs

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never Skip Tests**: Always run full test suite
2. **Review Changes**: Security-critical code requires peer review
3. **Gas Limits**: Test gas consumption for all functions
4. **Event Logging**: Emit events for all state changes
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs

### For Deployers

1. **Use Multisig**: Transfer ownership to multisig wallet
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with limited budgets
3. **Monitor Events**: Set up real-time monitoring
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Have pause/upgrade plan
5. **Audit Results**: Address all audit findings

### For Users

1. **Verify Contracts**: Check contract addresses
2. **Understand Risks**: Review documentation
3. **Start Small**: Test with small amounts first
4. **Monitor Transactions**: Watch for unexpected behavior
5. **Report Issues**: Use responsible disclosure

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security email - to be set]
3. Include:
   - Description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial response acknowledging receipt
- **7 days**: Preliminary assessment of severity
- **30 days**: Fix development and testing
- **60 days**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

### Bounty Program

We plan to establish a bug bounty program. Details TBA.

## Security Audit Status

- **Status**: Not yet audited
- **Planned**: Q4 2024
- **Scope**: All core contracts
- **Auditor**: TBD

## Security Updates

### Version History

- v0.1.0 (Current): Initial implementation
  - Basic security features implemented
  - Test coverage established
  - Documentation in progress

### Planned Improvements

1. **Multi-sig Integration**: Replace single owner with multisig
2. **Pausable Contracts**: Add emergency pause functionality
3. **Rate Limiting**: Enhanced rate limit algorithms
4. **Circuit Implementation**: Replace proof verification placeholder
5. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of critical functions

## Dependencies

### OpenZeppelin Contracts

We use audited OpenZeppelin contracts for:
- Access Control (Ownable)
- Security (ReentrancyGuard)
- Token standards (if needed)

Always use specific versions, never `^` or `~`:
```json
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "5.0.0"
```

## Incident Response

### In Case of Exploit

1. **Detect**: Monitor for unusual activity
2. **Pause**: Use emergency pause if available
3. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Communicate**: Notify users and stakeholders
5. **Fix**: Deploy patched contracts
6. **Post-Mortem**: Document and learn

### Contact Channels

- Email: [security email]
- Discord: [if available]
- GitHub: @kleakkola (for verified reporters only)

## Compliance

- **License**: MIT (see LICENSE file)
- **Jurisdiction**: [To be determined]
- **Data Privacy**: Zero-knowledge by design
- **AML/KYC**: Not implemented (decentralized protocol)
